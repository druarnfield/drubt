# DBT Metrics Manager TUI - Development Actions Log

## 2024-12-30 - Phase 2 Implementation Started

### Phase 2 Objectives
Implementing core services and advanced UI components for the DBT Metrics Manager TUI. This phase focuses on the business logic layer that will power metric discovery, SQL parsing, and seed file management.

### 🎯 Phase 2 Scope
1. **Core Services**:
   - SQL Parser service using sqlglot for dbt SQL file analysis
   - Metric Analyzer service for pattern-based discovery of metric columns
   - Seed Manager service for reading/writing metric_definitions.csv files

2. **Advanced UI Screens**:
   - Model Explorer screen with tree view navigation and column details
   - Discovery Wizard screen for guided metric discovery workflow
   - Metrics Library screen for CRUD operations on existing metrics

3. **Enhanced Widgets**:
   - DataTable widget for displaying tabular data with sorting/filtering
   - MetricForm widget for editing metric definitions
   - ModelTree widget for hierarchical model navigation

4. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Unit tests for all new services with >90% coverage
   - Integration tests for complete user workflows
   - Performance tests with large datasets
