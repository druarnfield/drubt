- **Testing Framework**: Added pytest with comprehensive unit tests (12 tests passing)

#### Data Models & Services
- **Metric Model**: Complete dataclass with validation for direct, ratio, and custom metric types
- **DBT Model**: Representation of dbt models with column information and rollup detection
- **DBT Reader Service**: Parses manifest.json and catalog.json artifacts, validates projects
- **Configuration System**: JSON-based config with user-friendly defaults and persistence

#### State Management
- **AppState**: Central state management with SQLite persistence for history
- **Project Loading**: Validates and loads dbt projects with progress tracking
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

#### User Interface
- **Main Application**: Textual-based TUI with proper navigation and keyboard shortcuts
- **Dashboard Screen**: Welcome screen, project overview, statistics cards, recent activity
- **Settings Screen**: Project configuration, directory browser, recent projects list
- **CSS Styling**: Professional terminal styling with responsive design principles
- **Navigation**: F1-F5 function keys, help system, proper screen transitions

#### Documentation
- **CLAUDE.md**: Comprehensive guidance for future development
- **README.md**: User documentation with installation and usage instructions
- **Architecture Documentation**: Preserved original planning documents

### 🧪 Test Results
All 12 unit tests passing:
- ✅ Metric model creation and validation (4 tests)
- ✅ DBT Reader service functionality (7 tests) 
- ✅ Project validation and model parsing (1 test)

### 🎯 Key Features Working
1. **Project Management**: Load/validate dbt projects with helpful error messages
2. **Dashboard Interface**: Clean terminal UI showing project statistics and recent activity
3. **Settings Configuration**: Browse and select dbt project directories
4. **Data Persistence**: SQLite database for project history and user settings
5. **Module System**: Proper Python package structure with entry points

### 📋 Technical Implementation Details
- **Framework**: Textual 3.5.0 for terminal UI with Rich 14.0.0 for text rendering
- **Data Processing**: Pandas 2.3.0 for future CSV operations
- **Architecture**: Modular design with screens, widgets, services, and state management
- **Database**: SQLite for local persistence without external dependencies
- **Testing**: Pytest with temporary file fixtures for reliable testing

### 🔧 Installation & Usage

```

### 🚀 Next Phase Recommendations
Phase 1 provides a solid foundation. Phase 2 should focus on:
1. **Model Explorer**: Tree view of dbt models with column details
2. **Metric Discovery**: Pattern matching engine for automatic metric detection
3. **Metric Library**: CRUD operations for managing existing metrics
4. **Seed File Operations**: Read/write metric_definitions.csv files
5. **Advanced Widgets**: Data tables, forms, and modal dialogs

### 🔍 Testing Notes
- Application launches successfully and displays welcome screen
- All core modules import without errors
- Configuration system creates proper app directory structure
- Database initialization works correctly
- Console script entry point configured (needs testing)

### 💡 Lessons Learned
1. Textual CSS doesn't support media queries - kept styling simple
2. SQLite provides excellent local persistence without complexity
3. Modular architecture makes testing and development straightforward
4. Rich error handling and validation essential for good UX
5. Comprehensive documentation critical for future development
